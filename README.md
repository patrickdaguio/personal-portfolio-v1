## Description

I wanted to create a website to showcase my skills and projects. This is the first iteration meaning I am hoping to improve on the design and interactivity of the website as I improve as a developer and perhaps change the framework it was built on.

This was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6+), SCSS with BEM methodology, GSAP for animations, ParcelJS as the module bundler and other JS libraries.

Thanks for checking out the project! üòÅ
